        <h2>4. Client Obligations</h2>
        <p>Clients are expected to:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-dim);">

        <h2>5. Payments and Fees</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1. Billing Structure</h3>

            <li>All payments are invoiced in United States Dollars (USD) unless otherwise specified.</li>
            <li>A minimum 50% advance payment is required to initiate any project, unless agreed otherwise.</li>
            <li>Remaining balances must be paid upon completion or milestone approval.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2. Late Payments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Late payments beyond 7 days may incur a 2% monthly interest charge.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>5.3. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Due to the strategic and time-based nature of marketing work, no refunds are provided once services have commenced, except in cases of contractual breach or mutual agreement.</p>

        <h2>6. Advertising Platforms and Third-Party Tools</h2>
        <p>
            Bloomly.fit manages campaigns across third-party platforms (e.g., Meta, Google, TikTok, Mailchimp, Shopify). While we aim to achieve optimal results, we do not control these platforms' algorithms, performance, or policy changes.
        </p>
        <p>We are not responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sudden increases in advertising costs (CPC/CPM).</li>
            <li>Account suspensions caused by platform policy enforcement.</li>
            <li>Technical outages or external service disruptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clients remain responsible for their own ad account payments unless specified otherwise in the service agreement.</p>

        <h2>7. Performance Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            Bloomly.fit employs industry best practices and data-driven strategies. However, marketing results depend on many factors — including budget, audience behavior, competition, and market trends.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not guarantee specific metrics such as revenue growth, follower increase, or sales conversions. Our commitment is to deliver professional, ethical, and performance-oriented marketing based on agreed objectives.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        
        <h3>8.1. Ownership</h3>
        <p>
            All original creative content (copy, graphics, videos, campaign concepts, etc.) remains the property of Bloomly.fit until full payment is received. Upon full payment, ownership of final deliverables transfers to the client for the purposes defined in their agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2. Agency Use</h3>
        <p>
            Bloomly.fit retains the right to display completed work — including visuals, case studies, and campaign results — in our portfolio, marketing materials, and website, unless confidentiality terms prohibit it.
        </p>

        <h3>8.3. Client Materials</h3>
        <p>
            Clients warrant that any materials provided (logos, videos, trademarks) do not infringe on third-party rights. Clients are solely responsible for legal clearance of their content.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            Both parties agree to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any business, marketing, or personal data exchanged during the partnership. Confidential information shall not be disclosed to any third party without written consent, except as required by Egyptian law.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Bloomly.fit complies with applicable U.S. data protection laws and regulations. We collect and process client data solely for legitimate business purposes, as described in our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>Clients must ensure their own marketing data and customer lists comply with applicable data protection regulations (including state privacy laws, GDPR, or others).</p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted under applicable U.S. law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bloomly.fit shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential losses, including lost profits or data.</li>
            <li>Total liability for any claim shall not exceed the total fees paid by the client in the 3 months preceding the claim.</li>
            <li>We assume no responsibility for losses caused by client-provided materials, third-party tools, or force majeure events.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            Either party may terminate the engagement with 14 days' written notice. Termination by the client before project completion will not entitle them to refunds of paid fees. Upon termination, all completed work to date will be invoiced and must be paid immediately.
        </p>
        <p>Bloomly.fit reserves the right to terminate an agreement without notice if the client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engages in unethical or illegal business activities;</li>
            <li>Fails to make timely payments;</li>
            <li>Damages the reputation of Bloomly.fit or its affiliates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13. Non-Solicitation</h2>
        <p>
            During the term of engagement and for 12 months thereafter, the client agrees not to directly solicit or hire any employee, contractor, or consultant of Bloomly.fit without prior written consent.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>
            Neither party shall be held liable for delays or non-performance caused by events beyond reasonable control, including natural disasters, internet outages, strikes, government restrictions, or war.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming and the United States of America. All disputes shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of Wyoming, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Amendments</h2>
        <p>
            Bloomly.fit reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Revised Terms will be posted on our website with the updated effective date. Your continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of such changes.
